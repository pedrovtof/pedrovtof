## Good morning, afternoon and night!

My name is Pedro Fonseca, and I am from SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil. I love writing scripts for developer systems, but I confess that Infrastructure and Databases are also an important part of my routine.

I have experience working in app support, addressing client-reported bugs for banks, and I also have a background in automation for internal systems. I have more than 1 year of experience as a DBA, although in practice, I am more of a DBRE, handling cloud infrastructure and tasks such as configuring virtual machines.

I have a passion for Windows, but I admit that Linux is better for me. I personally prefer Debian and Ubuntu, though I do respect RockyLinux as well.

I am not the biggest fan of open-source, but I use it regularly. I also have a passion for IoT (Arduino).
